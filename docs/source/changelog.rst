Migration Guide
---------------

From 0.1.0 to 0.1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 0.1.2 release is fully backward compatible with 0.1.0. The main addition is the simplified direct SMILES evaluation:

**New in 0.1.2:**

.. code-block:: python

   # Direct SMILES evaluation (new)
   results = benchmarker.benchmark(generated_smiles)

**Still supported from 0.1.0:**

.. code-block:: python

   # Model-based evaluation (existing)
   results = benchmarker.benchmark_model(model)

No code changes are required when upgrading from 0.1.0 to 0.1.2.

Deprecation Policy
------------------

We follow semantic versioning and maintain backward compatibility within major versions:

- **Minor versions** (0.x.0): May add new features but won't break existing functionality
- **Patch versions** (0.0.x): Bug fixes and documentation improvements only
- **Major versions** (x.0.0): May include breaking changes with migration guide

Deprecated features will be marked as such for at least one minor version before removal.
